# Purpose: Test of SLURM functionality
#          Bluegene/Q only: Test to make sure that the correct number of
#          nodes and tasks in a job and a step.
#
# Output:  "TEST: #.#" followed by "SUCCESS" if test was successful, OR
#          "FAILURE: ..." otherwise with an explanation of the failure, OR
#          anything else indicates a failure mode that must be investigated.
