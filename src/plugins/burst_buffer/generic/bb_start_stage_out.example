# I. BB_DIRECTORY (environment variable): Defines head of burst buffer file
#    system
#    A. .slurm_state, child of BB_DIRECTORY, contains state information, file
#       format is "TotalSize=#"
#    B. Slurm job ID number, child directories of BB_DIRECTORY, one per job
#       1. .slurm_state, child of Slurm job ID directory, contains state
#          information, file format is
#	   "UserID=# JobID=# Name=name State=name Size=#"
#          (NOTE: "UserID" must be first)
#          (NOTE: Either the JobID or Name should be specified, but not both)
