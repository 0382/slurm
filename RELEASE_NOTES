RELEASE NOTES FOR SLURM VERSION 2.4
5 October 2011


IMPORTANT NOTE:
If using the slurmdbd (SLURM DataBase Daemon) you must update this first.
The 2.4 slurmdbd will work with SLURM daemons of version 2.1.3 and above.
You will not need to update all clusters at the same time, but it is very
important to update slurmdbd first and having it running before updating
any other clusters making use of it.  No real harm will come from updating
your systems before the slurmdbd, but they will not talk to each other
until you do.  Also at least the first time running the slurmdbd you need to
make sure your my.cnf file has innodb_buffer_pool_size equal to at least 64M.
You can accomplish this by adding the line

innodb_buffer_pool_size=64M

under the [mysqld] reference in the my.cnf file and restarting the mysqld.
This is needed when converting large tables over to the new database schema.

SLURM can be upgraded from version 2.2 to version 2.4 without loss of jobs or
other state information.


HIGHLIGHTS
==========
* Major modifications to support IBM BlueGene/Q systems.


CONFIGURATION FILE CHANGES (see "man slurm.conf" for details)
=============================================================
* "RebootProgram" added
* "ReconfigFlags" added
* "SlurmdDebugLevel" and "SlurmctldDebugLevel" now accept string names in
  addition to numeric values (e.g. "info", "verbose", "debug", etc.). Output
  of scontrol and sview commands also use the string names.
* Changed default value of "StateSaveLocation" configuration parameter from
  "/tmp" to "/var/spool" to help avoid purging.


COMMAND CHANGES (see man pages for details)
===========================================
* Modified advance reservation to select resources optimized for network
  topology and accept multiple specific block sizes rather than a single node
  count.
* Added trigger flag for a permanent trigger. The trigger will NOT be purged
  after an event occurs, but only when explicitly deleted.
* Added the ability to reboot all compute nodes after they become idle. The
  RebootProgram configuration parameter must be set and an authorized user
  must execute the command "scontrol reboot_nodes".
* Added the ability to update a node's NodeAddr and NodeHostName with scontrol.


BLUEGENE SPECIFIC CHANGES
=========================
* Changde to output tools labels from "BP" to "Midplane" (i.e. "BP_List" was
  changed to "MidplaneList").
