RELEASE NOTES FOR SLURM VERSION 23.02

IMPORTANT NOTES:
If using the slurmdbd (Slurm DataBase Daemon) you must update this first.

NOTE: If using a backup DBD you must start the primary first to do any
database conversion, the backup will not start until this has happened.

The 23.02 slurmdbd will work with Slurm daemons of version 21.08 and above.
You will not need to update all clusters at the same time, but it is very
important to update slurmdbd first and having it running before updating
any other clusters making use of it.

Slurm can be upgraded from version 21.08 or 22.05 to version 23.02 without loss
of jobs or other state information. Upgrading directly from an earlier version
of Slurm will result in loss of state information.

All SPANK plugins must be recompiled when upgrading from any Slurm version
prior to 23.02.

NOTE: PMIx v1.x is no longer supported.

HIGHLIGHTS
==========
 -- Make scontrol reconfigure and sending a SIGHUP to the slurmctld behave the
    same. If you were using SIGHUP as a 'lighter' scontrol reconfigure to rotate
    logs please update your scripts to use SIGUSR2 instead.
 -- burst_buffer/lua - pass the job's UID and GID to slurm_bb_pre_run,
    slurm_bb_data_in, slurm_bb_post_run, and slurm_bb_data_out in
    burst_buffer.lua.
 -- Change cloud nodes to show by default. PrivateData=cloud is no longer
    needed.
 -- sreport - Count planned (FKA reserved) time for jobs running in IGNORE_JOBS
    reservations. Previously was lumped into IDLE time.
 -- job_container/tmpfs - Support running with an arbitrary list of private
    mount points (/tmp and /dev/shm are the default, but not required).
 -- job_container/tmpfs - Set more environment variables in InitScript.

CONFIGURATION FILE CHANGES (see appropriate man page for details)
=====================================================================
 - job_container.conf - Added "Dirs" option to list desired private mount
   points.
 -- node_features plugins - invalid users specified for AllowUserBoot will now
    result in fatal() rather than just an error.

COMMAND CHANGES (see man pages for details)
===========================================
 -- sacctmgr - no longer force updates to the AdminComment, Comment, or
    SystemComment to lower-case.
 -- sinfo - Add -F/--future option to sinfo to display future nodes.
 -- sacct - Rename 'Reserved' field to 'Planned' to match sreport and the
    nomenclature of the 'Planned' node.
 -- scontrol - advanced reservation flag MAINT will no longer replace nodes,
    similar to STATIC_ALLOC

API CHANGES
===========
 -- job_container plugins - container_p_stepd_create() function signature
    replaced uint32_t uid with stepd_step_rec_t* step.
