RELEASE NOTES FOR SLURM VERSION 22.05

IMPORTANT NOTES:
If using the slurmdbd (Slurm DataBase Daemon) you must update this first.

NOTE: If using a backup DBD you must start the primary first to do any
database conversion, the backup will not start until this has happened.

The 22.05 slurmdbd will work with Slurm daemons of version 20.11 and above.
You will not need to update all clusters at the same time, but it is very
important to update slurmdbd first and having it running before updating
any other clusters making use of it.

Slurm can be upgraded from version 20.11 or 21.08 to version 22.05 without loss
of jobs or other state information. Upgrading directly from an earlier version
of Slurm will result in loss of state information.

All SPANK plugins must be recompiled when upgrading from any Slurm version
prior to 22.05.

NOTE: PMIx v1.x is no longer supported.

HIGHLIGHTS
==========
 -- The template slurmrestd.service unit file now defaults to listen on both the
    Unix socket and the slurmrestd port.
 -- The template slurmrestd.service unit file now defaults to enable auth/jwt and
    the munge unit is no longer a dependency by default.
 -- Add extra 'EnvironmentFile=-/etc/default/$service' setting to service files.
 -- Allow jobs to pack onto nodes already rebooting with the desired features.
 -- Reset job start time after nodes are rebooted, previously only done for
    cloud/power save boots.
 -- Node features (if any) are passed to RebootProgram if run from slurmctld.
 -- Fail srun when using invalid --cpu-bind options (e.g. --cpu-bind=map_cpu:99
    when only 10 cpus are allocated).
 -- Storing batch scripts and env vars are now in indexed tables using
    substantially less disk space.  Those storing scripts in 21.08 will all
    be moved and indexed automatically.
 -- Run MailProg through slurmscriptd instead of directly fork+exec()'ing
    from slurmctld.
 -- Add acct_gather_interconnect/sysfs plugin.
