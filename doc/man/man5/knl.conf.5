.SH "NAME"
knl.conf \- Slurm configuration file for Intel Knights Landing processor.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This ASCII file which describes configuration information for Intel Knights
Landing processors and it's name may depend upon the NodeFeatures plugin
configured in Slurm. For example, on Cray systems NodeFeatures should be configured
to "knl_cray" and its configuration file will be read from "knl_cray.conf".
The file location can be modified at system build time using the
DEFAULT_SLURM_CONF parameter or at execution time by setting the SLURM_CONF
environment variable. The file will always be located in the
same directory as the \fBslurm.conf\fP file.
This file is optional.
.LP
Parameter names are case insensitive.
Any text following a "#" in the configuration file is treated
as a comment through the end of that line.
Changes to the configuration file take effect upon restart of
Slurm daemons, daemon receipt of the SIGHUP signal, or execution
of the command "scontrol reconfigure" unless otherwise noted.
.LP
The overall configuration parameters available include:

.TP
\fBCapmcPath\fR
Fully qualified path to the \fBcapmc\fR program.
The default value is "/opt/cray/capmc/default/bin/capmc".
This parameter is used only by the "knl_cray.conf" plugin.

.TP
\fBCapmcTimeout\fR
Time limit for the \fBcapmc\fR program to return status information milliseconds.
The default value is 1000 milliseconds.
This parameter is used only by the "knl_cray.conf" plugin.

.TP
\fBDefaultMCDRAM\fR
Specify the default MCDRAM modes for job's which do not specify a value.
This is only used when a node is booted and the job which has been allocated
the node does not specify a desired MCDRAM mode.
The default value is "cache".
.RS
.TP 17
\fBcache\fR
All of MCDRAM to be used as cache.
.TP
\fBequal\fR
MCDRAM to be used partly as cache and partly combined with primary memory.
.TP
\fBflat\fR
MCDRAM to be combined with primary memory into a "flat" memory space.
.RE

.TP
\fBDefaultNUMA\fR
Specify the default NUMA modes for job's which do not specify a value.
This is only used when a node is booted and the job which has been allocated
the node does not specify a desired NUMA mode.
The default value is "a2a".
.RS
.TP 17
\fBa2a\fR
All to all
.TP
\fBsnc2\fR
Sub\-NUMA cluster 2
.TP

.TP
\fBhemi\fR
Hemisphere
.TP
\fBquad\fR

.RE

.TP
\fBDmidecodePath\fR
Fully qualified path to the \fBdmidecode\fR program, which identifies current
KNL configuration by viewing BIOS settings.
The default value is "/usr/sbin/dmidecode".

.TP
\fBLogFile\fR
Fully qualified path to a log file.
The default value is SlurmctldLogFile from the slurm.conf configuration file.

the appropriate configuration).
