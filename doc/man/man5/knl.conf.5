.SH "NAME"
knl.conf \- Slurm configuration file for Intel Knights Landing processor.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This ASCII file which describes configuration information for Intel Knights
Landing processors and it's name may depend upon the NodeFeatures plugin
configured in Slurm. For example, on Cray systems NodeFeatures should be configured
to "knl_cray" and its configuration file will be read from "knl_cray.conf".
The file location can be modified at system build time using the
DEFAULT_SLURM_CONF parameter or at execution time by setting the SLURM_CONF
environment variable. The file will always be located in the
same directory as the \fBslurm.conf\fP file.
This file is optional.
.LP
Parameter names are case insensitive.
Any text following a "#" in the configuration file is treated
as a comment through the end of that line.
Changes to the configuration file take effect upon restart of
Slurm daemons, daemon receipt of the SIGHUP signal, or execution
of the command "scontrol reconfigure" unless otherwise noted.
.LP
